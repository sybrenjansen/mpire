Changelog
=========

2.1.1
-----

*(2021-08-26)*

* Fixed a bug with newer versions of tqdm. The progress bar would throw an ``AttributeError`` when connected to a
  dashboard.
* README and documentation updated

2.1.0
-----

*(2021-08-06)*

* Workers now have their own task queue, which speeds up tasks with bigger payloads
* Fixed progress bar showing error information when completed without error
* Fixed progress bar and worker insights not displaying properly when using threading
* Progress bar handling improved accross several scenarios
* Dashboard can now handle progress bars when using ``spawn`` or ``forkserver`` as start method
* Added closing of ``multiprocessing.JoinableQueue`` objects, to clean up intermediate junk
* Removed ``numpy`` dependency
* Made ``dill`` optional again. In many cases it slows processing down

2.0.0
-----

*(2021-07-07)*

* Worker insights added, providing users insight in multiprocessing efficiency
* ``worker_init`` and ``worker_exit`` parameters added to each ``map`` function
* ``max_active_tasks`` is now set to ``n_jobs * 2`` when ``max_active_tasks=None``, to speed up most jobs
* ``n_splits`` is now set to ``n_jobs * 64`` when both ``chunk_size`` and ``n_splits`` are ``None``
* Dashboard ports can now be configured
* Renamed ``func_pointer`` to ``func`` in each ``map`` function
* Fixed a bug with the `threading` backend not terminating correctly
* Fixed a bug with the progress bar not showing correctly in notebooks
* Using ``multiprocess`` is now the default
* Added some debug logging
* Refactored a lot of code
* Minor bug fixes, which should make things more stable.
* Removed Python 3.5 support
* Removed ``add_task``, ``get_result``, ``insert_poison_pill``, ``stop_workers``, and ``join`` functions from
  :obj:`mpire.WorkerPool`. Made ``start_workers`` private.  There wasn't any reason to use these functions.

* You can now pass on a dictionary as an argument which will be unpacked accordingly using the ``**``-operator.
* New function :meth:`mpire.utils.make_single_arguments` added which allows you to create an iterable of single argument
  tuples out of an iterable of single arguments

0.7.0
-----

*(2017-12-11)*

* :meth:`mpire.utils.chunk_tasks` is now available as a public function

0.6.2
-----

*(2017-11-07)*

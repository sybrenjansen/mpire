-----

*(2021-11-29)*

* Changed progress bar handler process to thread, making it more stable (especially in notebooks)
* Changed progress bar tasks completed queue to array, to make it more responsive and faster

2.3.2
-----

*(2021-11-19)*

* Included license file in source distribution (`#25`_)

.. _#25: https://github.com/Slimmer-AI/mpire/pull/25

2.3.1
-----

*(2021-11-16)*

* Made connecting to the tqdm manager more robust (`#23`_)

.. _#23: https://github.com/Slimmer-AI/mpire/issues/23

2.3.0
-----

*(2021-10-15)*

* Fixed progress bar in a particular setting with iPython and django installed (`#13`_)
* ``keep_alive`` now works even when the function to be called or any other parameter passed to the ``map`` function is
  changed (`#15`_)
* Moved ``enable_insights`` to the WorkerPool constructor. Using ``enable_insights`` from a ``map`` function is now
  deprecated and will be removed in MPIRE v2.6.0.
* Restructured docs and updated several sections for Windows users.

.. _#13: https://github.com/Slimmer-AI/mpire/pull/13
.. _#15: https://github.com/Slimmer-AI/mpire/issues/15

2.2.1
-----

*(2021-08-31)*

* Fixed compatibility with newer tqdm versions (``>= 4.62.2``) (`#11`_)

.. _#11: https://github.com/Slimmer-AI/mpire/issues/11

2.2.0
-----

*(2021-08-30)*

* Added support for Windows (`#6`_, `#7`_). Support has a few caveats:

  * When using worker insights the arguments of the top 5 longest tasks are not available
  * Progress bar is not supported when using threading as start method
  * When using ``dill`` and an exception occurs, or when the exception occurs in an exit function, it can print
    additional ``OSError`` messages in the terminal, but these can be safely ignored.

.. _#7: https://github.com/Slimmer-AI/mpire/issues/7

2.1.1
-----

*(2021-08-26)*

* Fixed a bug with newer versions of tqdm. The progress bar would throw an ``AttributeError`` when connected to a
  dashboard.
* README and documentation updated

2.1.0
-----

*(2021-08-06)*

* Workers now have their own task queue, which speeds up tasks with bigger payloads
* Fixed progress bar showing error information when completed without error
* Fixed progress bar and worker insights not displaying properly when using threading
* Progress bar handling improved accross several scenarios
* Dashboard can now handle progress bars when using ``spawn`` or ``forkserver`` as start method
* Added closing of ``multiprocessing.JoinableQueue`` objects, to clean up intermediate junk
* Removed ``numpy`` dependency
* Made ``dill`` optional again. In many cases it slows processing down

2.0.0
-----

*(2021-07-07)*

* Worker insights added, providing users insight in multiprocessing efficiency
* ``worker_init`` and ``worker_exit`` parameters added to each ``map`` function
* ``max_active_tasks`` is now set to ``n_jobs * 2`` when ``max_active_tasks=None``, to speed up most jobs
* ``n_splits`` is now set to ``n_jobs * 64`` when both ``chunk_size`` and ``n_splits`` are ``None``
* Dashboard ports can now be configured
* Renamed ``func_pointer`` to ``func`` in each ``map`` function
* Fixed a bug with the `threading` backend not terminating correctly
* Fixed a bug with the progress bar not showing correctly in notebooks
* Using ``multiprocess`` is now the default
* Added some debug logging
* Refactored a lot of code
* Minor bug fixes, which should make things more stable.
* Removed Python 3.5 support
* Removed ``add_task``, ``get_result``, ``insert_poison_pill``, ``stop_workers``, and ``join`` functions from
  :obj:`mpire.WorkerPool`. Made ``start_workers`` private.  There wasn't any reason to use these functions.
